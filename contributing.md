## How to contribute

### Pull Requests
- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `readme.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.
- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.
- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please [squash them](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) before submitting.

### Issues
- **Answer all items in the issue template** - It helps us resolve problems without a lot of back-and-forth.
- **No support requests** - The maintainers and people who follow this project are all busy people. Please do not expect them to help you code something that will only work inside your project or debug an issue that is most likely your own doing.
